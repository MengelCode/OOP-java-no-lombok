/* Portions of the code in this project came from a program file "SpaceInvader.java" written by
 * Dr. Hong Sung, professor of Computer Science at the University of Central Oklahoma.
 * Dr. Sung made the "SpaceInvader.java" file available to me.  There are sections of code
 * that were directly copied from the file "SpaceInvader.java" that Dr. Sung wrote.  I have made
 * changes to some of the sections of copied code and I added code of
 * my own.  I give credit to Dr. Sung for writing "SpaceInvader.java", a program file containing code
 * which I have used to make this game, "Missile Exchange".  I give credit to Dr. Sung for
 * teaching me object-oriented programming design concepts that I have used to make this game.
 * It would not have been possible for me to make this program if he had not taught me those concepts.
